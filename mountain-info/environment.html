		<h2>Environmental Concerns in the West Kootenay</h2>
		
		<p>The Kootenay Mountaineering Club has always considered the well being of our mountain environment to be of extreme importance. From our support of the Valhalla Wilderness Society in the effort for the establishment of the Valhalla Provincial Park in 1984 to our ongoing effort to leave no trace of our yearly three weeks of week long hiking camps with 20 people each week in a pristine location, the club believes that our lives are better with wilderness around us.</p>
