			<h3>Day 1, Fly In</h3>

			<p>Our convoy of two trucks drive from Nelson to a parking area near the end of the 
				North Fosthall Creek FSR. Highland Helicopter from Nakusp arrives early, so it 
				is a mad scramble to erect chicken wire barricades around the trucks, and 
				change out of our penny loafers and into our mountain boots. This year's "camp" 
				breaks with tradition, and is a fly-in, traverse, and walk-out trip, so the 
				standard refrigerators and satellite dishes are missing, making for light packs 
				and easy loading of the chopper (two easy loads in a Bell 206). With last 
				year's disaster still fresh in my mind, I check the back storage compartment 8 
				times on each load to ensure nothing is left behind.</p>
			
			<p>Under mostly sunny skies, we are whisked to a beautiful alpine meadow on the 
				south side of Mt. Odin at 82 L/9 204990, 7,130 ft. Soft bare-foot-friendly 
				meadow, babbling brooks, large boulders for food hanging, and splendid views 
				make for an idyllic setting for our first campsite. Idyllic, that is, until the 
				clouds of mosquitoes descend upon us.</p>
			
			<figure class="centre-figure">

			</figure>
			
			<p>Mt. Grady to the east is on our hit list, so our objective for the 
				rest of the day is to recce a route over the "shark's tooth ridge" to the east. 
				Maurice and Diane head off to check out the highest and most northerly notch, 
				the route of choice for the KMC 1990 Climbing Camp ("Notch 1"). Sandy and I 
				don't like the sound of Kim Kratky's description of this route in the 1,990 
				Karabiner, so we opt to take a peek at the lowest and most southerly of three 
				obvious notches in the north-south trending ridgeline ("Notch 3"). David, who 
				isn't feeling great, decides to rest up in camp. Idling about trying to read 
				his book, he discovers that the Avon "Skin So Soft", that he picked up at a 
				recent Tupperware Party, repels mosquitoes like burley repels sharks.</p>
				
			<p>Maurice and Diane return with tales of loose, dirty, down-sloping slabs on the 
				east side of Notch 1. Sandy and I find the gully up to Notch 3 to be loose, 
				dirty, and generally unpleasant, but no worse than stiff class 3; the other 
				side is an easy descent on talus and meadow. We decide on Notch 3 (82 L/9 
				213987, 7,719 ft), but to break into things slowly, also decide to leave Grady 
				for day 3.</p>
			
			<h3>Day 2, Mounts Odin and Unnamed</h3>

			<p>The next day everyone heads off as a group to try the East Ridge of Odin, the 
				highest peak in the range. Ascending to the col east of Odin (82 L/9 2,14997, 
				8,540 ft) proves straightforward (meadow, boulders, and snow), and takes us an 
				hour and a half. Just below the col we discover shattered pieces of a 
				helicopter rotor blade and various unidentified bits of broken metal - as we're 
				in prime heli-ski terrain, we assume we've stumbled upon a crash site. Maybe 
				walking out isn't such a bad idea after all.</p>
			
			<figure class="centre-figure">
				<img alt="Mount Odin from the east" src="images/odin.jpg">
					<figcaption>Mount Odin from Unnamed (from the east)</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<p>At the col we rope up for our journey up the Frigg Glacier. The glacier is easy 
			going, but we initially switchback a route across to the north (climbers right) 
			side of the Odin Glacier to avoid some steep bare ice. On the way, we pause to 
			rubber-neck at the fine views of Arrow Lake and the impressive Frigg Tower to 
			the east. We then navigate back across the width of the glacier to the East 
			Ridge of Odin a short distance below the top. From here we easily scramble up 
			pleasant class 3 rock to reach the summit, our first of the camp, at high noon.</p>
			
			<p>It is a beautiful, sunny and hot day, and we are treated to amazing views of Mt. 
				Thor, Mt. Niflheim, and Stegosaur Ridge that joins them, as well the northern Gold Range as far as Mt. Begbie (we think). To the west is the aesthetic silhouette of Mt. Fosthall, a view that will become very familiar over the coming days.</p>
			
			<p>After a prolonged summit lounge, Sandy begins earning her nickname, and gets us 
				moving again. We retrace our steps back to the col and arrive at 2:30. As the 
				day is yet young, we eventually all saunter off and make our way along the 
				ridge to the summit of Unnamed, which provides very fine views of Odin and Grady.</p>
			
			<h3>Day 3, Mount Grady and Unnamed</h3>
			
			<p>Mount Grady is the western peak of the impressive double-summited massif of 
				Burnham and Grady. The peaks are sheer on both south and (especially) north 
				sides, sport an impressive 500-foot notch between them, and are very visible 
				from Highway 6 north of Nakusp and on the Galena Bay ferry.</p>
			
			<p>Today Sandra and I elect to have a go at Mt. Grady. We leave camp at 5:00 am and 
				grovel our way up the gully to Notch 3. By 5:15 am it is already warm, and we 
				are in shorts and t-shirts and I am sweating heavily. We reach the notch at 
				6:15 and descend mostly easy ground to the lake below (site of the 1973 and 
				1p990 "high camp") by 6:50 am.</p>
				
			<p>From here, we start following Kim Kratky's excellent instructions printed in the 
				1990 Karabiner. We ascend the gully to prominent notch in the next N-S shark's 
				tooth ridge; it looks to be treadmill scree, but turns out to be quite 
				reasonable, and after scrambling the class 3 chimney in the middle of three 
				gullies that exit the main gully, we reach the notch at 7:20 am.</p>
				
			<p>From the notch we descend down into the next drainage and contour around the 
				basin and then climb boulders and steep, grassy goat tracks to gain the South 
				Ridge of Grady a short distance south (climber's right) of a prominent notch. 
				We are finally on our route now, a hard four hours from camp.</p>
				
			<p>The south ridge starts as an amble, but soon rears up. We soon reach the two 
				gullies Kim refers to, and take the right (east), less obvious one. While Kim 
				and Hamish scrambled this section in flip-flops, Sandy and I soon have the rope 
				out - you're supposed to use a rope on fourth class terrain, right?</p>

			<figure class="left-figure">
				<img src="images/sandyongrady_small.jpg">
				<figcaption>Sandy on the East Ridge of Grady</figcaption>
			</figure>
				
				<p>Unfortunately, with our on-and-off again use of the rope, we're rather slow, 
				and don't reach the junction with the West Ridge until 11:00. From here things 
				get really exciting (for such a geriatric pair as ourselves). The climbing 
				isn't particularly difficult, but the exposure is thrilling - steep slabs for 
				1,000 feet on the south; the north side of the knife-edged ridge is overhanging, 
				providing 3,000 feet of vertical entertainment. We feel cowardly as we carefully 
				belay much of this section knowing that Kim and Hamish skittered along unroped 
				and in bare feet.</p>
			
			<p>The West Ridge is long and (for us) complicated. Alas, 2:45 finds us topping out 
				on a high point on the ridge about 100 vertical and 500 horizontal feet shy of 
				the summit. As the West Ridge is sharp and overhanging to the north, but often 
				not particularly steep, we know that rappelling isn't an option, and we will 
				need to down climb almost the whole way. Discretion (cowardice?) wins out over 
				ambition and we turn tail bitterly disappointed that after almost 10 hours of 
				effort we are thwarted so close to the top.</p>
				
			<p>We descend the West Ridge with two 30 m raps and much down climbing, but as we 
				short-rope most of it we are much faster than anticipated. We grind our way 
				home over the two intervening ridges to arrive back at camp at just as the last 
				of the daylight fades. The rest of the crew, bless their hearts, take pity on 
				us and quickly ply us with hot food and drink.</p>
				
			<>David and Maurice spent a relaxing day wandering the ridges above camp, 
				summiting Unnamed again, and investigating a route along the ridge line to 
				Grady. Diane wandered in the meadows near camp doing the stuff artists do.</p>
			
			<h3>Day 4, Move Camp to Under Mount Gunnerson:</h3>

			<p>Having eaten as much of our heavy loads as possible, it's time to move on. We 
				traverse west on meadow and through light trees to "Silvertip" Lake (82 L/9 1,87982, 6,800 ft) where we meet a geology graduate student from Queens University and her 
				assistant who are camped here doing fieldwork.</p>
			
			<p>We follow the outlet stream for a short distance, and then turn north (right) 
				and follow a meadow ramp about 200 m. Here we follow a narrow ramp back south 
				through the first cliff band. We descend through some light bush and then take 
				a series of ramps, ledges, and game trails left across the top of another cliff 
				band. We exit off this cliff face onto a talus slope about half way down the 
				cliff. Once on the talus, we easily descend to the forest below. From here we 
				make a descending traverse to the northwest through thick bush and 
				avalanche-damaged forest to a lake at 82 L/9 175985 (5,650 ft). David starts 
				threatening the management of Avon.</p>
			
			<p>It is another cloudless and very hot day, so we take shelter in the shade of 
				some trees at the lakeshore for our lunch. After taking sustenance, we continue 
				up the drainage a short distance and then turn left and bushwhack up steep 
				ground, eventually making camp on the shore of a beautiful small lake</a> at 82 L/9 1,63993 (6,545 ft). The lake is remarkably warm, and 
				most of us jump in for a refreshing swim. It would be a splendid camp but for 
				the bugs: the mosquitoes are unbelievable. David starts threatening the workers 
				at Avon.</p>
			
			<h3>Day 5, Saturday Peak:</h3>

			<p>Today, David, Sandra, and I head off at the civilized hour of 7:00 am for an 
				assault of Mt Gunnerson. Maurice and Diane elect to have a leisurely breakfast 
				and then wander the ridges around Mt Skade and maybe follow us on Gunnerson.</p>
			
			<p>Gunnerson is an attractive shark-fin shaped peak, but its lower slopes look 
				suspiciously loose. The three of wade through a dense cloud of mosquitoes all 
				the way to the Gunnerson-Skade col. From here it is obvious that the lower 
				slopes of Gunnerson are horrible - , crumbly, and loose slag. It is a quick and 
				unanimous decision to change our objective to the mighty, but more distant, 
				Saturday Peak.</p>
			
			<p>Later in the day Maurice and Diane poke around a bit looking for a route around 
				the slag, but find none.</p>
			
			<figure class="right-figure">
				<img alt="Doug Climbing Steep Snow on Saturday Peak" src="images/dougonsaturdaysteep_small.jpg">
				<figcation>Climbing Steep Snow On Saturday Pk.</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>David, Sandra, and I continue over Mt Skade, which is followed by a few more ups 
				and downs before reaching the toe of the Saturday Glacier. Out comes the rope, and we tromp up the gentle west side to below the bergshrund. From here it 
				gets interesting: I lead off crossing the gapping 'schrund on a solid bridge, 
				and ascend snow to 50+ degrees (big, big runout) to reach a rib of rock 
				descending from the NW Ridge. After Dave and Sandy join me, Sandy leads off on 
				fourth class rock to reach the NW Ridge</a> proper. From here is a very pleasant class 3 scramble on solid rock to the summit<sup>(<a href="#2" name="2">2</a>)</sup>.</p>
			
			<p>As it is yet another hot, cloudless day, we lollygag around the summit 
				rubber-necking at the view for a while before Sandy gets us moving on our 
				descent. On the way down the ridge, we elect to descend a wide, loose ramp 
				dropping from right to left (east to west) that delivers us to the top of the 
				glacier about 100 m NW of our ascent route. A full 30 m rappel takes us just to 
				the lower lip of the bergshrund. We then scamper down the glacier this time 
				skirting around the terminus of NW Ridge of Saturday. Rather repeat the up and 
				down over Skade and associated ridgelines, we descend the drainage of the north 
				fork of Ledge Creek; it is mostly filled with avalanche debris and makes for 
				quick travel. A loathed end-of-day grunt back up to camp is dispatched in 
				plenty of time for a dip in lake.</p>
			
			<h3>Day 6, Move Camp to Peters Lake:</h3>

			<p>The attractive form of the north side of Mt Fosthall has been calling to us all 
				week, so we decide to move camp a day earlier than planned so we can make of 
				ascent of Fosthall before we exit out to the vehicles on Saturday. On our way 
				to camp at Peters Lake, we will tackle Gates Ledge, a significant obstacle in 
				the form of a ridgeline protected by cliffs, rotten rock, and Gold Range bush. 
				We have been checking it out along the way, and it doesn't look too bad, but 
				Dave Smith has warned that finding the route through the cliffs is tricky and 
				involves some nasty bush.</p>

			<p>We head west from camp and climb a open ramp up a ridge line and start contouring 
				around the basin below Icebound Lake hoping to stay above the bush as long as 
				possible. Relatively easy travel, with the exception of one unpleasant traverse 
				across a greasy slope, brings us to the top of a ridge line running parallel to, 
				and just east of, Gates Ledge (around 82 L/9 163982). This ridge initially 
				provides pleasant travel in open forest, but after a while, thickening bush 
				pushes us into the boulders and thin trees of the drainage to the west. 
				Traversing through increasing bush from here, we eventually spot a narrow 
				boulder field that we think is the one Dave talked about and the one we had 
				spied from our vantage points to the east. We traverse another steep slope of 
				greasy vegetation and ascend the (climber's) right hand side of the boulders. 
				When the boulders run out, we continue up steep and nasty bush (hand-over-hand 
				alders and huckleberry), eventually ascending a faint animal trail up very 
				steep dirt and soft vegetation to top out on Gates Ledge at 82 L/8 172965 
				(small cairn on top).</p>

			<figure class="centre-figure">
				<img alt="Fields of wildflowers above Gates Ledge" src="images/meadowabovegates.jpg">
				<figcaption>Fields of Wildflowers enroute to Valley of the Moon</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<p>From here conditions improve dramatically. We continue on through open forest in 
				the hot sun to a lunch spot in the shade by a stream. After lunch we continue 
				through amazing fields of wildflowers on our way to the unusually named Valley 
				of the Moon (I figure it should be named Valley of the Flowers) and the very 
				beautiful Fawn Lake. I'm itching to plunge my sweaty, smelly person into the 
				lake, but after a short break, Sandy again gets the herd moving, and we begin 
				our descent to Peters Lake. An easy walk through light to moderate bush brings 
				us to an official Monashee Provincial Park campground on the south shore of 
				Peters Lake. The campground is deserted, and I for one, will enjoy not hanging 
				the food tonight. Everyone but Sandy enjoys a swim in the remarkably warm 
				water. Mercifully (and remarkably), this campsite is nearly bug free, and we 
				enjoy sitting around unmolested for the first time in nearly a week.</p>
			
			<h3>Day 7, Mount Fosthall:</h3>
			
			<p>Today the five us head off together to tackle the south ridge of Mt Fosthall. 
				After enjoying fine views of the attractive north side of this peak from many 
				vantage points over the past 6 days, the climb itself is a bit disappointing.</p>
			
			<p>A sturdy BC Parks bridge gets us across the creek flowing out of South Caribou 
				Pass, and then an intermittent trail takes us easily to South Caribou Pass, 
				where we lounge in the sun conducting an animated environmental cost/benefit 
				analysis of the heli-ski/heli-hike industry.</p>
			
			<figure class="centre-figure">
				<img alt="Peters Lake and peaks to the east from South Cariboo Pass" src="images/peterslake.jpg">
			<figcaption>Peters Lake and peaks to the east from South Cariboo Pass</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<p>From the pass, we contour around, mostly on pleasant meadow and easy talus to 
				the South Ridge of Fosthall. Here the ascent route deteriorates into a 
				Rockies-style rubble heap. But not to be deterred, we grovel our way up the 
				unstable but easy angled ridge to the summit. Having dispensed with the slag, 
				we are treated to splendid views (cloudless skies again) of all of our previous ascents 
				and much of the terrain we have traversed in the past week, so despite my 
				whining, it was a very appropriate ascent for our last climb</a> of the trip.</p>
			
			<p>An easy descent the same way gets us home in plenty of time for the now 
				obligatory pre-dinner swim.</p>
			
			<h3>Day 8, Head Home:</h3>

			<p>Sadly our trip is nearly at its end. But the moaning and snivelling about 
				damaged feet has risen to a crescendo, and everyone is pretty much ready to 
				head home. We head off following a Park's trail, which soon becomes 
				intermittent, to Margie Lake. Our route takes us through delightful meadow. 
				Unfortunately, it also takes us past some swampy areas, and the incredible 
				clouds of mosquitoes push me personally to near the breaking point - they seem 
				to fight each other to be the first to bite me through my freshly applied 
				insect repellent.</p>
			
			<p>There is rumoured to be a blazed trail from Margie Lake to the North Fosthall 
				Creek FSR, but we couldn't find it. We followed a flagged route from Margie 
				Lake that climbed high above the lake and then ... ended. We steeled ourselves 
				for one final bushwhack to the FSR, but contrary to our fears, it proved to be 
				quite good travel and we were soon at the road end. Once on the road, it was a 
				quick jaunt downhill to the vehicles.</p>

			<p>We had 8 cloudless and very hot days - in Canada, and in the mountains. 
				Extraordinary. We travelled through seldom visited and very spectacular 
				country. We climbed a few peaks, and fed more than a few mosquitoes. We teased 
				David mercilessly about whatever we could. Our daily swims in the warm lakes 
				were an unexpected bonus. Overall, it was a grand trip, and one to remember.</p>

				Dave Smith, a Nelson-based ACMG guide, led an ACC group on very similar trip in 
				July 2002; he very generously shared with me his "Guides Report" which was a 
				very helpful planning tool and gave us some much appreciated directions at a 
				couple junctures along the way.</li>
