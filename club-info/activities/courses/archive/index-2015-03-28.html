			<h3 class="left">Canadian Red Cross Wilderness and Remote First Aid</h3>
			<em>November 14, 15 & 16th, 2014</em>
			
			
			<p>(November 14 will be a 4 hour evening session; 15 and 16 will be 8 hour days) KMC member rate $200.</p>
			
			<p>In isolated areas or wilderness settings, where equipment, communication and assistance is limited, adventurers need a higher level of training to work and respond to emergencies. This course teaches comprehensive first aid and CPR techniques for anyone who travels off the pavement. Successful completion results in a 3 year nationally recognized certification.</p>
			
			<h3 class="left">AST 1</h3>
			<em><strong>December 13-14, 2014</strong></em>
			
			<p>Course value $225 - KMC member rate: $180 incl. GST (You save $45!)</p>
			
			<p>The introductory course, Avalanche Skills Training 1, is a 2 day weekend program. Students will learn how to recognize and manage avalanche terrain, read snow pack information and better choose up track routes and descent runs.</p>
			
			<h3 class="left">Companion Rescue & Refresher Course</h3>
			<em><strong>December 14, 2014</strong></em>
			
			<p>Course value $100 â€“ KMC member rate $75 incl. GST (You save $25!)</p>
			
			<p>Has it been awhile since your last avalanche skills training?  Review and renew your practical rescue skills, get information about new avalanche equipment as well as discover updated probing, shoveling and group rescue techniques.</p>
			
			<h3 class="left">AST 2</h3>
			<em><strong>January 22*, 23-25, 2015 *January 22 is half day (late afternoon/evening)</strong></em>
			
			<p>Course value $467 - KMC member rate: $395 incl. GST (You save $72!)</p>
			
			<p>The more advanced program is for skiers or boarders that would like to become more independent or to follow a professional course, like level one in the CAA. The Avalanche Skills Training 2 is a 3 1/2 day over the weekend program. Students will deepen their knowledge, experience and skills for better decision making in avalanche terrain. Topics from AST 1 will be covered with more depth and emphasis on adapting personal exposure based on changing conditions & field observations. The course is primarily field based with evening classroom debriefs.</p>
			
			<h3 class="left">AST 1 for snowshoers</h3>
			<em><strong>January 31 and February 1, 2015 (tentative)</strong></em>
			
			<p>We would like to know if there is any interest to organize a custom AST 1 course for KMC members on snowshoes, like we did earlier this year. If we have enough participants the course fee will be similar to the AST-1 for skiers listed above.
			</p>
			
			<div class="announcement">
			
			<p>The Kootenay Mountaineering Club is subsidizing these courses to the amount of $25 per member. Please note we have a $75 course subsidy limit for any one member per calendar year.</p>
			
			<p>Volunteer trip organizers will receive an additional subsidy of $25 over and above the regular member $25 discount, already included in the posted rates. To qualify, you must have organized at least 4 trips in the past year. This program recognizes the importance of all trip organizers within our club.</p>
