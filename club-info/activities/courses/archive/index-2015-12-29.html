			<h3 class="left">Canadian Red Cross Wilderness and Remote First Aid</h3>
			<em><strong>November 6, 7 & 8, 2015</strong></em>
			
			<p>In isolated areas or wilderness settings, where equipment, communication and assistance is limited, adventurers need a higher level of training to work and respond to emergencies. This course teaches comprehensive first aid and CPR techniques for hikers, bikers, climbers, skiers, boaters, hunters, fishers, and anyone who travels off the pavement.</p>

			<p>The course includes the material in Standard First Aid & CPR‐C, plus strategies for providing extended care for up to 24 hours. Topics covered include airway, breathing and circulation emergencies, and secondary surveys to determine any other life threatening or ‘trip‐threatening’ conditions. Also included is theory and practical skills to increase proficiency in small wound care, head and spinal injuries, muscle, bone and joint injuries. Sudden medical emergencies, poisonings, and environmental hazards will also be covered.</p>

			<p>A significant component of the course is taught in an outdoor setting and requires greater physical activity and endurance than typical first aid training. Though we will not be backpacking or staying out overnight, please come prepared to spend time outside, whatever the weather.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>No pre-requisites are required</li>
				<li>20‐hours of high quality instruction</li>
				<li>A high quality water‐proof, tear resistant, packable wilderness medicine book</li>
				<li>Successful completion results in a 3 year nationally recognized certification</li>
			</ul>
