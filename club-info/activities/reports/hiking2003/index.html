			<h2>Letter from Hiking Camp Week 1, August 2003</h2>
			<p class="centered"><cite>Graham Kenyon</cite></p>
			
			<p>Dear Garth and Pat,</p>
			
			<p>It was Janet's idea. She proposed it to the rest of us at the first get-together 
			after the hustle of tent pitching, biffy digging and kitchen organizing was 
			more or less complete. The valley was at peace again after the shattering 
			intrusion of the helicopter depositing 19 hikers and a ton of gear beside the 
			lake. Despite the 7000 ft elevation the late afternoon sun was warm, too warm 
			for the mosquitoes to get really serious just yet, though the biffy diggers 
			reported initial skirmishes in the shade of the trees as they struggled to 
			relocate huge rocks from their centuries-old resting places.</p>

			<p>Janet proposed that we dedicate the experiences of this camp to the two of you; 
			a kind of spiritual inclusion, acknowledging the tough time you are having 
			right now, and your impending departure from this land where you have 
			experienced so many outdoors adventures and so much happiness together. I was 
			puzzled as to how one went about dedicating experiences. However, where there 
			is a will, as the saying goes, and certainly there is a will amongst all of us 
			here to express the depth of feeling and concern that we have for you in your 
			present circumstances. But how to do this without getting maudlin about it... 
			sympathy always seems so inadequate, and empathy requires more imagination than 
			most of us are capable of, despite the fact that many of those present are on 
			the wrong side of their mid-life crisis and regard each new ache or pain with 
			the keen interest of the owner of a 20 year old car pondering on the 
			significance of the latest noise under the hood. Mind you, considering the vile 
			concoctions that some at this camp were prepared to swallow under the pseudonym 
			of 'herbal tea', and the prepossession of others to forsake their predatory 
			ancestry for beans, lentils and broccoli, this concern for the fragility of the 
			human metabolism is not limited to the older folks.</p>
			
			<p>But I digress. As you know, hiking camps are an assemblage of the peculiar in 
			pursuit of the extraordinary; to be there is an experience, which is what this 
			letter is about. So let's try to give you some flavour of our camp, 
			incorporating the individual 'most memorable experiences' provided to me by 
			those present, though they may not recognize their contributions as explicitly 
			as they might wish - the 'artistic license' I warned them about.</p>
			
			<p>First, the place; someone will likely show you the pictures, but they never 
			quite do it justice do they? You need to feel the warm sun, to feel the fresh 
			breeze and see how it moves the trees and the flowers. You need to hear the 
			stream rippling over the rocks, the up-close chuckling and splashing as it 
			cascades down the hillside, clear and icy cold from the subterranean caverns 
			under the limestone plateau; and the comforting murmur heard from the sleeping 
			bag, blanketing those other mysterious noises of the night. The sounds of the 
			mosquitoes, the calls of birds, the whisper of the wind through the trees, the 
			rumble of distant thunder in the night, the chatter and bursts of laughter from 
			people enjoying each other's company, the drone of aircraft trailing their 
			paths across the sky; rarely is there silence in the mountains. You need to 
			smell the clean, spicy aroma of the sub-alpine forest, the damp undergrowth in 
			the perpetual shade of north-facing cliffs, the silty mud disturbed along the 
			edge of alpine lakes, the smell of fresh coffee in the morning, and the hint of 
			smoke in the air from the fires burning to the west. You need to feel the 
			abrasive roughness of eroded limestone rock, to touch the fossilized images of 
			seabed detritus locked in the sedimentary slate, to feel the icy touch of water 
			so cold it aches like scalding heat. You need to feel the effort of climbing 
			the grassy slope, over the rocks and on up the ridge, the panting breath, the 
			sweat, the aching muscles, and the pounding heart. The view, the scenery, even 
			the attainment of the summit, all would be empty experiences without all the 
			senses being engaged. You know this of course from the wealth of your 
			experience. Interesting, isn't it, that the exceptional outdoor experiences you 
			carry with you through your life are those that are a composite of sensual 
			experiences rather than just the view?</p>
			
			<p>Nevertheless, I am sitting up here on the plateau enjoying the view, overlooking 
			the campsite and beyond to the east over the Albert River to the grey, rocky 
			ridges fringed with dark forest and the spire-like peaks bordering the Royal 
			Group. It is spectacular, typical of the Rockies, rank upon rank of mountains, 
			the detail fading into the hazy outlines of Japanese prints in the distant. I 
			am several hundred feet above the camp, which is located beside a lake on a 
			perched bench just below timberline, a scattering of tents tucked in the 
			welcome shade of trees, the lakeshore silt pocked deeply with the tracks of 
			elk, moose and deer.</p>
			
			<p>Wildlife is part of the camp experience. Nick and Bobbie, first time KMC 
			campers, parked themselves way down the lake; brave souls undeterred by the 
			prospect of grizzlies following the well-trampled game trail along the 
			lakeshore past their tent. The more experienced KMCers camped safely across the 
			lake had their flash cameras set up in the event of screams in the night, but 
			that didn't happen. Mary was camped next door, but she sleeps so soundly 
			(judging by her response to breakfast duty) that she wouldn't have heard 
			anything anyway.</p>
			
			<p>Returning to their tent, Bobbie found one of her boots, stored under the fly, 
			had been chewed. Not surprising, you say, but what was surprising was that one 
			of Nick's boots had disappeared entirely. A full scale search eventually 
			unearthed the boot, undamaged and wedged in a rock pile at least 50 yards from 
			his tent, a heck of a haul for whatever creature lives in that rock pile. No 
			more boots left outside; but, not to be outdone, next day the persistent 
			creature chewed his (her?) way into the tent, ate a great hole in Nick's shirt, 
			and dragged one of his camp shoes off into the bush. Welcome to the KMC! At 
			least they weren't eaten by grizzly bears.</p>
			
			<p>Another first timer, Gary, made the mistake of following partner Cheryl into the 
			forest at the far end of the lake. Somehow gravity confused them and they were 
			some considerable distance down into the Vietnam jungle (Gary's descriptive) 
			before Cheryl could be convinced that 'up' was above their current location, 
			not further down. They say that adversity strengthens relationships. It was 
			Cheryl's first experience as cook; rumour has it she almost resigned on the 
			first day - thank God for the Swiss army and the invention of their knives, 
			though what else does one do in the Swiss army?</p>
			
			<p>When asked later whether he had enjoyed his first (now there is a presumption) 
			KMC camp, Gary observed that having scrambled up a steep cliff from the lake 
			while being eaten alive by mosquitoes, side-hilled across a loose scree slope 
			far too high to be comfortable, tramped across a steep snow field (snow on July 
			31st!), sweated up a rocky ridge in the hot sun, then dashed back down in time 
			to pack buckets of water and help partner Cheryl get supper ready for 19 hungry 
			hikers, this was an experience he would surely recommend to his golfing 
			buddies. Welcome to the KMC!</p>
			
			<p>Back on the plateau, to the immediate south of the camp rises a rocky, scree 
			ridge capped by three crumbling peaks. A few remnant snow patches on the north 
			side of this ridge feed a small turquoise lake that overflows in an open 
			stream, which quickly disappears into underground chasms beneath the plateau. 
			Rocks tossed into one of the openings rattle down for seven or eight seconds, 
			the sound faintly dissipating in the cold, dark depths below. Farther along the 
			base of the ridge, the plateau dips down over grassy benches to other turquoise 
			lakes trapped behind old moraines. Here at a spectacular site, dominated by a 
			peak reminiscent of the Matterhorn, a recreational lodge is under construction, 
			the ambitious project of entrepreneurs from Canmore and Invermere.</p>
			
			<p>The western boundary of the plateau is skirted by a series of steps of craggy, 
			broken limestone terminating abruptly in a headwall plunging precipitously 
			towards the Cross River valley where our vehicles are parked. Farther up this 
			valley is the jumping off point for the Skyline Hikers camp, another intensive 
			recreation site, albeit a temporary one, presently accommodating 50 hikers. We 
			bumped into several parties of these folks during our expeditions to the north 
			of our camp, beyond the long, rocky ridge of Whiteman Mountain to the 
			delightful, flower-strewn meadows on the way to 'Azul Lake'.</p>
			
			<p>What a wonderful walk that was, identified by several as their 'outstanding 
			experience' of the camp. Climb up through the forest from the far end of the 
			lake, following the game trails out on to the open meadows, then enjoy the 
			sheer pleasure of wandering across the grassy slopes with the magnificent 
			panorama of peaks, the Albert River and the distant Leman Lake off to the east. 
			What an incredible display of alpine flowers strewn amongst the wiry grasses, 
			punctuated by stately, lime green Lyall's larches. Birds fluttered here and 
			there, challenging each other from the low shrubs and rocks with a repetitive 
			che-choo, che-choo whistle, identified by our resident expert as the 
			grey-crowned rosy finch - of course. Warm sunshine, a cooling breeze, the 
			nodding purple, yellow, white, red and blue of myriad flowers, blue sky and 
			cotton wool clouds, the muted cascade of a distant river; indeed a place, and 
			an experience, to remember.</p>
			
			<p>Beyond the meadows, the climb to a col between two barren, rounded peaks, to a 
			place that eons ago was at the bottom of a sea, as evidenced by the imprints of 
			ancient fossils in the shards of slatey shale littering the ground. Over the 
			pass is another panorama of peaks, including the unmistakeable outline of Mt. 
			Assiniboine in the far distance. At one time a glacier was lodged here on the 
			north side of Whiteman Mountain. Nothing remains now but the piles of rocky 
			moraine, apparently barren until one sees a few pioneer plants that have found 
			sufficient organic matter lodged here and there, beginning the process of 
			centuries that will ultimately create more grassy, flower-strewn meadows. Who 
			will walk those meadows then? What an interesting challenge to the imagination, 
			and for speculation and introspection on 'the meaning of life'.</p>
			
			<p>'Azul Lake' lies below the moraine - not an official name, but exotic enough to 
			appropriately describe this jewel of a lake. Azul is Spanish for blue, and this 
			lake is blue, but what an incredibly intense blue! It almost glows with an 
			intensity that increases as one approaches closer. A breeze shimmers across its 
			surface and splashes it with sparkling diamonds; then calm again, and the blue 
			gleams up through the translucent depths. A lake made for solitude and 
			contemplation, yet now visited regularly by the Skyline group, and, yes, by us 
			too. Wilderness is shrinking.</p>
			
			<p>Solitude and contemplation; notwithstanding the admonitions about hiking alone, 
			this must be one of the most frequently broken 'rules' of KMC camps. Almost 
			everyone will take some time during the week to be alone, to enjoy the solitude 
			of the mountains. It doesn't necessarily involve great risk, though risk is a 
			fact of life anywhere and in my view those engaged in travelling alone tend to 
			be more cautious anyway. Even staying in camp when everyone else has left is an 
			experience in solitude, though it requires Zen-like concentration to 
			contemplate when one is the sole target of all the bugs in the valley. Hence 
			the attraction of even a short walk to higher ground, and of course one thing 
			leads to another...</p>

			</blockquote>
			
			<p>The plateau is a great place for solitude, a great place to just wander about, 
			or to sit and be still in mind and body, absorbing the experience of being 
			here, now, detached from the concerns of present life in an environment of 
			constancy that will still be here, very much like this, in a hundred years and 
			a thousand years. Constant while changing: summer, winter, sunshine and storms, 
			the constant change that creates the unchanging in the time perspective of the 
			mountains.</p>
			
			<p>Time to go, reluctantly, from this place. Already the others will be drifting in 
			from their hikes with tales of their experiences, tales of peaks climbed, of 
			crumbling ridges, of lakes, of meadows, of wild creatures, of new flowers 
			discovered, of the tracks of a grizzly bear. Later on this last night, around 
			the 'camp fire' of unlit logs (really!), there will be more tales of other 
			camps, of other people, of other experiences, the pleasures of past experiences 
			relived in the telling, the recollection of old friends from years gone by.</p>
			
			<p>Garth, Pat, you are amongst those 'old friends' who will share those campfires 
			in years to come. There is talk of returning to some of the earlier sites, to 
			Hume Creek, and to others of fond memories that you will recall. Perhaps this 
			reflects a desire to recapture experiences of another time, to look backwards 
			over the wealth of past experiences rather than the uncertainty of the future, 
			though considering the adventuresome spirit of the 'elder generation' of the 
			KMC that is hardly likely. The uncertainties of the future serve as more of a 
			challenge than an impediment to these folks! The tilting balance of the years 
			is more a reason to seize opportunities for new experiences than to rest on the 
			laurels of the past.</p>
			
			<p>However, no matter where the KMC chooses to adventure with their future camps, 
			you will be there in spirit and in the conversations around the fire, just as 
			you were this time. Not forever of course, nothing is forever. What possible 
			relevance shall we have to whomever passes this way in the centuries to come? 
			It is sufficient that we were privileged to be here, to enjoy our experiences 
			in the mountains, and to share these good times with good friends.</p>
			
			<p>We wish you well; we wish you courage and perseverance, patience and forbearance 
			as you journey on. Think of us; think of the experiences you have enjoyed in 
			the mountains, a place that can be wild and desolate, arduous and downright 
			scary at times, and also peaceful and serene and beautiful.</p>
			
			<p>Sincerely,</p>
			
			<p>Graham Kenyon, for and on behalf of all Camp 1 participants.</p>
