			<p>Flowers have long been a feature of articles in the Karabiner, especially hiking camp articles. The competitions to see who could identify the most species appear to have been ferocious. Well... maybe not ferocious but spirited.</p>

			<h4>"Name the Flowers" competition for fame and glory!</h4>
			<p>We have a winner!</p>
			<p>...unless someone would care to discuss the identifications with Muriel. She says: <cite>"If anyone is a keen alpine wildflower viewer and wants to  agree or disagree with my identifications I'd like to hear from them."</cite></p>
			<p>Even if the names are contested and changed, it is still loads of fame and glory crowned upon Muriel! It's the Kootenay comments that were the deciding factor for the judge.</p>
