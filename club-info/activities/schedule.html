			<p>The Members version of the schedule is available from a link to the Google Doc on the password protected <a href="/club-info/documents/member-files/">Members Only Documents</a> page.</p>
			
			
			<p>Most club trips are open to both members and non-members, but trip coordinators may choose to limit their trips to club members. Non-members are welcome to try one or two club trips, before joining the club. If you are interested in joining one of our trips as a guest, please contact the <a href="mailto:ski@kootenaymountaineeringclub.ca">Winter Trip Director</a> who will put you in contact with the trip coordinator. Contact the coordinator at least three days prior to the trip and read <a href="/club-info/documents/docs/Trip-Participant-Responsibilities.pdf">the guidelines for trip participants</a>. View the <a href="/club-info/documents/docs/KMC-Trip-Grading-Scale.pdf">trip grading scale</a> to see if the trip you want to join fits within your personal capabilities. Print out, read and sign our standard <a href="/club-info/documents/docs/FMCBC-KMC-Basic-Waiver.pdf">liability waiver</a>.  Give it to the trip coordinator on the day of the trip. You will not be allowed to join a KMC trip without a signed waiver.</p>
			
			<p>Enjoy your trip with the Kootenay Mountaineering Club!</p>
