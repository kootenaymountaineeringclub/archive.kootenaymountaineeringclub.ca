Welcome, this message comes from the Membership Director. Whether you just renewed your membership or are a first time member, here are a couple pieces of information to take note of.

For questions on membership matters, you can send an email to website@kootenaymountaineeringclub.ca . For any actual club type questions, please check http://kootenaymountaineeringclub.ca/club-info/contact-us.html for the email of an appropriate club director

Members Only Documents
----------------------

A link to the trip schedules on Google Docs and the members only membership list are available from the "Members Only" link on the "Club-Info -> Documents" page. Other things found there are executive meeting minutes, AGM minutes, club info, the member's only membership list, and the link to the Google Docs club outings schedule. The document area is protected by one login ID and password, which are:

        ID: KMCmember
        Password: 0ld-5l0ry   ... think "Old-Glory" with the Ohs changed to Zeros and the G changed to 5

Both are case sensitive. And yes, that password will once a year after membership expiry date and the new password will be announced on the members only email list. It won't be any harder than the current one :-)

Email list
----------------------

The club members email list is housed with a company called "TopicBox". The address to which you send email messages is:

        kmc-members@kmc.topicbox.com

If you are a new member, it may take a few days before your email address is added to the list, because this is a volunteer run organization. Your email must be on the list before you can send an email to kmc-members@kmc.topicbox.com.

The email list is not intended to be a wide open social media platform. Below are the guidelines formulated by the club Executive.

---------------------
Suggested Guidelines for Club email
---------------------

The KMC Membership email list is intended for club functioning. It should be used for the following occasions:

By Trip Leader
        - initial invitation for KMC trip, usually circulated 7-10 days in advance.
        - announcements of rescheduling or cancellation.

By members
        - if significant access issues are discovered on trails or access to trails.
        - if, after expressing a concern to the executive, you feel that a community discussion is appropriate.
        Note:
        - if you wish to send questions to the trip leader or make final trip arrangements among participants, please do that via private email.

By Executive
        - to advise of KMC functions.
        - to request membership response to club positions/projects/proposals.
        - to advise on issues/concerns it deems sufficiently important that all members be informed.

Please consider whether or not there is an urgent reason to inform all members in response to any of the above. Otherwise 'reply' rather than 'reply all'. If a member believes an issue/concern warrants email distribution to the membership, ask the executive or make use of other available social media.
