<h3><a id="1.6_Leader-Helicopter-Site"></a>Helicopter Staging Site Selection</h3>

<ol>
<li>There are a number of things to consider when choosing a rendezvous site for the helicopter loading area including:
	<ol class="letters">
		<li>room for the helicopter to land</li>
		<li>plenty of room for parking</li>
		<li>places to stage gear, load slings, and for people to wait.</li>
	</ol>
</li>

<li>The minimum area that the helicopter needs to land is governed by the diameter of the rotor. The blade diameter is typically 35 feet. A buffer of at least 20 feet should be provided around the helicopter. Therefore, the minimum area required is 75 feet. Pick a much larger site if possible.</li>

<li>If possible, choose a site with no trees in the immediate area. Fewer trees around make it easier for the pilot to manoeuvre.</li>

<li>A site with a drop-off to one side with no trees gives the pilot an opportunity to gain air speed by dropping down from the landing site. Higher air speed will give better lift for the helicopter.</li>

<li>The rotor wash throws up lots of dust and debris. Clean the area.</li>

<li>Parking should be available for at least 20 cars. Car pooling is strongly advised. Since the cars from the first camp will still be parked when the cars from the second camp arrive, a large parking area is needed. Low clearance vehicles should be discouraged unless it is obvious they will be able to negotiate the terrain.</li>

<li>Much gear is flown into camp. It should be divided into two piles - one pile for the bulky items that will be flown into camp in the sling, and one pile for the smaller, lighter items that will be placed in the baggage compartment in the helicopter. The pile for the sling loads should be some distance from the helicopter landing site so that the sling can be loaded without interfering with the helicopter loading. Choose a relatively flat spot so the sling can be stretched out and the gear stacked on it without tipping over.</li>

<li>Passengers should be staged from a spot that is below the level of the landing spot if possible. <strong>Do not allow passengers to approach the helicopter from a high point because of the danger of running into the rotor.</strong></li>
</ol>



				<h3><a id="sect1.1-F"></a>Leader/Cook Coordinator</h3>
				
				<h4>Tasks</h4>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Obtains the names of people from Registrar who have indicated on registration forms that they are interested in the leader or cook positions. Contacts past cooks to determine interest. Discuss with potential cooks their experience, qualifications, etc.</li>
					<li>Cooks are paid an honorarium of $200.00 but they need to fill out a registration form and send it prior to March 15 to the registrar. They need not enclose a camp fee cheque for the $500 unless they wish to participate in the lottery process for a camp spot if they are not selected as a cook.</li>
					<li>In February, send email to the KMC membership encouraging people to apply for the cook position, emphasizing the information above.</li>
					<li>In May, ensures each leader and cook has accessed the KMC website and read the manuals. If necessary, holds a meeting with new cooks and leaders to review job description and procedures.</li>
					<li>If a cook cancels just prior to camp, the coordinator is to secure a replacement.</li>
					<li>Reminds camp leaders that a gas allowance ($100) will be shared for the transport of the two camp boxes and other equipment.</li>
					<li>All camps must have a truck to transport camp boxes and equipment.</li>
					<li>Arranges with camp 1 leader to pick up the satellite phone from the KMC Hut Director.</li>
					<li>Arranges with camp 3 leader to return satellite phone to KMC Hut Director.</li>
					<li>Camp 3 leader returns the camp binder to the leader/cook coordinator.</li>
					<li>Reviews comments in camp binder and forwards to applicable committee members for review at fall HCC meeting.</li>
					<li>Purchases kitchen items as suggested by cooks.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3><a id="sect1.1-G"></a>Equipment Coordinator</h3>
				
				<h4>Tasks</h4>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Ensures that camp gear is returned to the designated equipment storage location.
						<ul>
							<li>Tents need to be erected and thoroughly dried and inspected for damage and repaired if needed before packing away for the winter.</li>
							<li>In the fall checks over all the camp equipment. Replaces or repairs anything that is worn out or broken. Ensures everything is clean and in working order.</li>
						</ul></li>
					<li>In June, checks the condition of the portable radio:
						<ul>
							<li>Checks the battery compartments for loose/broken contacts, corrosion, etc. and clean/repair as required.</li>
					<li>Replaces batteries (they will have been used the previous year).</li>
					<li>Labels the batteries with the year so that people know there are fresh batteries installed.</li>
					<li>Ensures that the batteries make good contact in the battery compartment.</li>
					<li>Ensures that the radio is programmed with the frequencies used in the area of camp: helicopter company, forest companies, others.</li>
					<li>Places a label on the battery case with a list of the programmed channels.</li>
					<li>Ensures that a spray can of waterproofing is made available for spot waterproofing as necessary during camps. (Tents are completely re-waterproofed every 2-3 years).</li>

					<li>Maintains first aid kit by checking medication expiry dates and adequacy of other supplies.</li>
					<li>Ensures equipment etc. described above goes into 1st camp and is returned after 3rd camp.</li>

				<h3><a id="sect1.2-E"></a>Cancellations/Withdrawals</h3>
				
				<!--#include virtual=includes/CancellationsWithdrawals.incl.html -->
				
				<h3><a id="sect1.2-F"></a>Waitlists</h3>
				
				<ol>
					<li>If there are more applicants than spots available, their names will be on one of three waitlists : Group A, B, or C.</li>
					<li>In the event of a cancellation, the first person on the Group A waitlist will be contacted by email and offered the spot. S/he will have 48 hours to advise of his/her decision. If the person does not take the available spot, or does not contact the registrar within 48 hours, the registrar goes to the next person on the same waitlist. If a second cancellation occurs for that camp, the spot gets offered again to the first person on the Group A waitlist.
		<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>(b) should a waitlisted person decline a second opportunity to go to a camp, he/she will be dropped from the waitlist.</li>
</ul>
			</li>
					<li>When a person/couple accepts a vacant spot they should ensure there are sufficient funds in their account as the cheque will be deposited within two days of their acceptance and the cancelling camper would then be issued a refund (less administration fee).</li>
					<li>When a cancellation occurs close to the camp date, then the 2nd and 3rd person on the waitlist may be contacted and advised of the opening if the first person on the waitlist has been offered the spot but has not yet confirmed. This process continues until the Group A waitlist is exhausted. The Group B through Group C waitlists will then follow the same process.</li>
					<li>If a couple is on the waitlist and a single spot becomes available, then the couple is bypassed and the name of the first single registrant is contacted about the spot.</li>
					<li>If a couple wish to be considered as singles on the waitlist, confirmation of this change must be received from both members of the couple.</li>
					<li>A non-resident member or non member may only be placed in camp if no resident members fill an available spot. This would not occur prior to June 1st.  A non-member would have to become a member to be able to go.</li>
						</ul></li>
					<li>Switching by mutual agreement between 2 campers assigned to any of the three camps will be allowed up to noon of June 1st. The switch is to be accompanied by immediate email advice to the two camp leaders affected as well as the Registrar.</li>
