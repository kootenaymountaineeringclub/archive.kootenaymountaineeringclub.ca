				<h2><a id="CampInfo"></a>Participant Camp Information</h2>
				
				<p>
				The Kootenay Mountaineering Club (KMC) sponsors three hiking camps each summer. All three camps are at the same site. The camp fee is $550 per person. 
				</p>				
				<p>
				Preparation and in-camp activities are a cooperative effort. Each camp has a volunteer leader who coordinates procedures, implements and follows KMC Hiking Camp policies, and facilitates an enjoyable hiking/camping experience. Campers are to be respectful to one another and keep a positive attitude. Illegal drug use, camp cook/leader criticism and/or bullying will result in being barred from future camps. The hiking camps uphold the environmentally friendly policies of the KMC. Camp participants are chosen by lottery. Those chosen to attend one of the camps will be asked to attend a pre-camp coordination meeting where food and logistic decisions and assignments will be made. It is also an opportunity to meet the camp leader and the other camp participants.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The KMC facilitates transportation and the set up and operation of the camps. The KMC is not a guide service.  While at camp participants choose their activities based upon their experience, skills, and the environment in which the camp is located. The camps are wilderness experiences with few conveniences not suited to the inexperienced hiker. It is strongly recommended that participants have some back country hiking experience, or, at a minimum, be a strong trail hiker. Campers must be at least 19 years of age on or before the first day of camp. All camp registrants must have an email address. All notifications and communications will be done by email only.
