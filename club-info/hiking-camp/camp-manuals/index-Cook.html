				<h2><a id="#job-description"></a>Camp Cook Job Description</h2>
				
				<p class="centered"><em>Please, if you are accepted as a camp cook and for any reason need to withdraw, notify the Cook Coordinator as soon as possible.</em></p>
				
				<p>
				The Hiking Camp Cook is responsible for managing and organizing the kitchen as well as preparing breakfasts and dinners for the 20 people in camp. The cook is assisted by the campers, as determined by the camp duty roster, for meal preparation, cleanup, and hauling water. Listed below are specific duties.
				</p>

				<h3>Preparation</h3>
				<p>
				Attend meeting of camp leaders and cooks (if held) to review preparations. Attend pre-camp meeting to explain menus and preparation to participants. At the pre-camp meeting participants decide whether they want borscht, minestrone or lentil soup for the first night’s dinner and also choose between veggie or meat chilli and veggie or meat pasta sauce. If salmon loaf is chosen for a dinner it must be server for Monday. They also can choose between chocolate cake or chocolate zucchini for one of the desserts. 
				</p>

				<h3>Schedule</h3>
				<p>
				A duty roster is prepared by lottery to assign campers to assist with meal preparation, cleanup etc.
				</p>
				<p>
				Breakfast is at 7:00 am. The cook will need to start preparation by 6:00 am. or earlier. New cooks may have to start earlier to get their routine established. The helper should arrive at 6:30 am. 
				</p>

				<p>
				Supper is at 6:00 pm. The cook needs to return to camp by 4:00 pm to start dinner. The helper will arrive at 5:15 pm to assist. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Get the supper cleanup started as soon as possible so that lunch making, dishwashing, etc. can be completed before dark. Wash water should be put on to heat as soon as breakfast or supper cooking is finished. NOTE: The wash water does not need to boil. Helpers are responsible for clean-ups after breakfast and dinner. The cook should make sure that all items are cleaned and returned to their proper storage place.
				</p>

				<h3>Propane</h3>
				<p>
				The propane is to be used with care. The two bottles are more than enough for the week-long camp if not wasted. Propane is not to be used for heating water for bathing or hair washing. Water heated for cleanup does not need to be boiling. Always turn off the main tank valve when the propane is not in use (in case there is a leak).
				</p>

				<h3>Meals</h3>
				
				<p class="centered"><em>For tips and guidelines from an experienced camp cook, please read <a  href="#cooks-comments">Jenny Ballies comments</a></em></p>
				<p>
				The cook monitors food supplies and makes participants aware that they should not help themselves to the food. Remind participants to serve themselves a moderate portion to assure that everyone gets a fair amount. If there are problems, the cook should dish out portions. If there are leftovers people can have seconds.
				</p>

				<p>
				Prepare foods as per the menu. The menu order may be rearranged by the cook, but the menu should not be changed. Ensure all foods provided are used. Prepare meals that may spoil easiest in warm weather (eg. Salmon loaf) first.
				</p>

				<p>
				<h4>Breakfast</h4>
				<p>
				On the evening prior, after dinner, once the dishes are all done, the water used for making juice and milk MUST be boiled). Make the powdered milk and orange juice in the morning with this water. Coffee, hot water, and hot cereal are prepared every morning. 
				</p>

				<h4>Lunch</h4>
				<p>
				Hikers are responsible for making their own lunches after dinner as soon as wash-up is finished. The cook is to assist with lunch set-up by getting the lunch supplies from the coolers to minimize the opening of the coolers (particularly in hot weather). 
				</p>
				<p>
				Lunch supplies include: bread, crackers, multi-grain buns, lunch meats (500 g/day), canned fish, cheese (1 kg/day), peanut butter, jam, mayonnaise, mustard, onions, celery, carrots and cookies (2 /person/day).
				</p>

				<h4>Tea Time</h4>

				<p>
				The first people back in camp can put on the tea for 4 pm. Allow about 15 min. to boil the water. People can either make their own in a cup (put out herbal, reg, or decaff teas). Or make a pot of tea -use 6 tea bags/pot. Allow 2 cookies/person for tea time. 
				</p>

				<h4>Dinner</h4>

				<p>
				Soup is made at every dinner - use leftovers from the previous evening's meal.
				</p>

				<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>

				<ul>
					<li>Hand sanitizer is provided for meal and lunch helpers to clean hands.</li>
					<li>OR - Have basin of soapy bleach water available for meal and lunch prep helpers to wash hands. Use hand towels, NOT tea towels, for drying hands.</li>
					<li>Save empty tins and containers for pouring grease into or storing leftovers.</li>
					<li>Baking soda can be used as a fire extinguisher in case of a grease fire.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>End of Camp</h3>

				<p>
				<strong>Camp 1 & 2</strong>: Certain items (dry goods, spices, non-perishables, etc.) will not be flown out of camp as they are required for subsequent camps. Some staples are bought by Camp 1 but are meant for all three camps. Check the shopping list and be sure to leave those items required for the next camps. . 
				</p>

				<p>
				<strong>All Camps</strong>: Each camp takes non-perishable food to the food bank – don't leave for camp 3

				<h2><a id="cooks-comments"></a>A Previous Cook's Comments</h2>

				<p class="centered"><cite>Jenny Baillie</cite></p>
				
				<h4>Breakfast</h4>

				<p>
				For the first couple of mornings I like to get to the cook tent around 5:30 a.m. to give myself time to get it together without rushing. I put a small pot of water on to boil for hand wash and tea for myself.
				</p>

				<p>
				Heat the 2 large pots for dish washing. These are taken off the stove later but at least starts the heating process.
				</p>

				<p>
				The next pot to go on is the porridge which ideally has been soaking overnight. It doesn't take that long to cook but can stand sitting with a last minute heat up just before 7 a.m. In between stirring the porridge I get the milk / juice / condiments / jams etc. out and arrange on table for serving.
				</p>

				<p>
				Get the bread for toast ready to go. It's a good idea to bring this into cook tent the evening before - one less thing to fetch. The "cook's helper" arrives at 6:30 a.m. and I like to give them the real job of whatever is on the menu e.g. pancakes or scrambled eggs or whatever. I make sure everything is at hand so they don't have to go looking and this job gives them one thing to focus on whilst I manage the coffee and tea.
				</p>

				<p>
				It is fairly crucial to have the coffee and tea pots on by 6 a.m so that by 6:30 both beverages can be made and ready by 6:45 a.m. when campers start to wander down.
				</p>

				<p>
				Serve porridge at 7 a.m. with toast on the go to follow with the eggs or whatever.
				</p>

				<p>
				As soon as there are some burners free put the dish washing water back on AND a second coffee water pot as there is usually need for at least 2 brews of café!
				</p>

				<h4>Dinner</h4>

				<p>
				Dinner is served at 6 p.m. Start no later than 4 p.m. otherwise there'll be trouble.
				</p>

				<p>
				Everything that needs heating up needs to go on the stove - soup/main etc
				</p>

				<p>
				I usually then get the vegetables together (quantities are important - consult the recipes) and ready for the 5 p.m. 'help' (one person but if another is able and willing it goes quicker of course). I give the making of the salads or peeling of carrots/potatoes etc.  to the helper with myself chipping in but I often need to attend to other duties including dessert/salad dressings etc.
				</p>

				<p>
				The soups need a bit of juggling and imagination with leftovers as a base for the next day.
				</p>

				<p>
				I hope everyone who is cooking is aware that leaving foods warm and fermenting and gathering bacteria is to be avoided.
				</p>

				<p>
				As soon as dinner is served put on the water for dishes.
				</p>

				<p>
				The reason I don't very often join the clan for sitting around and eating dinner is that I like to think about the next day and what I need to get out of the coolers to thaw overnight PLUS the lunch items also have to be organized.
				</p>

				<p>
				Before leaving the cook tent verify that: the propane is turned OFF AND nothing that will encourage creatures is left out AND the tent entry is zipped!
				</p>

				<p>
				HAVE FUN!
				</p>
