<h2><a id="cooler-management"></a>Management of Coolers and Frozen Food</h2>

<p>
It is highly recommended that the coolers be reorganized on Friday evening at the helicopter-loading site in the following manner. In a shady area that will remain out of the sun until loaded on the helicopter, aggregate all the coolers containing frozen food, dairy and meat, and frozen cakes and muffins. The cook and two helpers are necessary. Using two appropriately sized coolers (the older coolers are smaller than the new ones), separate out the food that needs to be kept cold into one for Tuesday/Wednesday, and one for Thursday/ Friday/Saturday morning from the list below. There should be no need to include ice in these coolers if they are full. They should be almost full and kept cold by the frozen and cold food inside along with the other cooling methods used at camp. The cook should be familiar with and have a copy of the menu. If the order of food is changed, those changes need to be made to the lists below. The food for Sunday/Monday that needs to be cold is put in a third cooler with some of the ice and moved to the cook tent. A fourth cooler will contain only ice.  A fifth cooler could be used for some of the bread if necessary. The produce cooler is a separate cooler.

Tape the coolers shut. Label with days of use and contents. Place insulation jackets around and on top of coolers.

<dt>Method of Refrigeration</dt>
<dd>Set up tarps in trees or on the north side of a steep bank to give complete sun protection. Obtain as much snow as possible (tarps seem to be the best way to carry snow but coolers also work. Place the above 2 coolers on a bed of snow, pack snow around them, cover with its own reflective blanket and forget about them until needed. Surround on one side for accessibility with produce cooler and coolers of ice (there will be a great deal of ice left over to keep the Sunday, Monday food cold, and the rest can be stored in a separate cooler on its own). Cover with wool blankets kept wet constantly (depending on temperature, wind, sun exposure) and then reflective tarps 
</dd>

<p>
Keep one cooler in the cook tent for that day and possibly the next day’s food. It could also contain most of the dairy if desired. The cook should make a list of all cold food needed for that day and make one trip to the coolers. 
</dd>

<dt>If there is no snow</dt>
<dd>Find an area near next to camp near a creek, lake, or water source and create a constantly shaded area with tarps. If storing in the creek, create a dam in the creek if possible to contain the coolers or stack rocks on them so they don’t float away. Keep watch after large rains or if it is a hot day when the volume of the creek may increase significantly. Close to the creek and not in the water is best. Keep the two coolers for Tuesday to Saturday and a cooler holding ice separate, with an insulation jacket around and on top, under their own tarp and blankets, and keep the blankets constantly wet. Keep the produce cooler and any other coolers you may want to keep in the shaded cooler area separate under their own tarp/blanket system so as not to disturb the two “cold coolers”. Ice can be added as needed to any of the coolers as they are taken down to the cook tent.
