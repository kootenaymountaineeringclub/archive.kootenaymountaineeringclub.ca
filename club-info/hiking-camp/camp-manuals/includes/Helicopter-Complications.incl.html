				<h2><a id="sect-1-7-Heli-Compl"></a>Helicopters â€“ Potential Complications</h2>
				
				<p>
				We have experienced some complications with the helicopter transportation. Listed below are items to keep in mind.
				</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li>The change of location option. When roads wash out or forest fire closures force a change, an alternate site should be available.</li>
				
					<li>Bad weather delays. If fog/clouds or other factors make flying impossible, it may be necessary to camp on the road. Camp one will have all the gear so there is usually no problem. Camps two and three must make provision to bring some emergency cooking equipment with them (eg. Coleman stove and pot to heat soup, tarp to cover food etc.).</li>
				
					<li>Non-performance by the helicopter company (due to bad weather, high winds, broken equipment, etc.). Make sure that the pilot or company representative offers solutions if they cannot complete their mission. Be aware of other machines that are available, but insist that the contractor make any arrangements. They must assume any extra ferry costs. Only the camp leader should speak for the group - no one else should offer comments or directions to the pilot.</li>
				
					<li>The number of trips the helicopter makes determines the cost. Make sure that loads are full to minimize trips. For a four passenger helicopter, five trips carrying passengers, and two carrying gear in a sling will normally be required. In addition, camp one (going in) and camp three (coming out) will require an additional sling load to transport camp gear. Make sure that this is fully discussed and understood by the contractor. Forty-five years of experience has given the Camp confidence of what works. Camp has had pilots insisting on short loads due to being fully loaded with fuel to start flight operations. This should only be acceptable if the weather is extremely hot, humid or windy.</li>
				
					<li>Question the helicopter company specifically about fuel on board at the pick up site. In remote areas they should be bringing fuel in barrels to maximize flight efficiency. This is called 'working for the customer' and is a best practice in the industry . Insist on it. Slinging barrels does add to ferry time but is cost effective over all. Astar type craft with a ski basket travels slower but can carry small drums of fuel. An option Camp has used in the past is to bring 45 gal drums ourselves.</li>
				
					<li>Ensure that the pilot brings slings. In the unlikely event there are no slings, extreme caution is necessary to ensure that camp gear is stowed safely in the helicopter. Ask the pilot for direction in loading (see section on Loading Procedures). This condition has occurred when the original contractor has sent a subcontractor without notice. They showed up without slings and no knowledge of what was expected.</li>
				
					<li>Assign someone to record flight time to cross-check billing.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<p>
				Altitude, temperature, humidity and turbulence all have a major impact on the performance of the helicopter, therefore Hiking Camp should take measures to record these conditions during flying operations. Load master perhaps? Operators use these variable conditions to justify slow times/speeds. Performance charts are available on line from the manufacturers of helicopters. Wikipedia has a very good explanation of helicopter performance.
