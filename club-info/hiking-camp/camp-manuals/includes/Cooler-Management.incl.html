<h2><a id="cooler-management"></a>Management of Coolers and Frozen Food</h2>

<p>The strategy is to organize the coolers so that they are not opened until required. Coolers are organized on Friday evening by the cook and two volunteers.</p>

<p>Put the 2 litre frozen meals in the following coolers:  
	<ul>
		<li>Sunday Monday Tuesday in one cooler.</li>
		<li>Wednesday Thursday Friday in a second cooler.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Method of Refrigeration managed by leader and volunteers</h3>

<p>Set up tarps in trees or on the north side of a steep bank to give complete sun protection. Obtain as much snow as possible (tarps seem to be the best way to carry snow but coolers also work. Place the above 2 coolers on a bed of snow, pack snow around them, cover with its own reflective blanket and forget about them until needed. Surround on one side for accessibility with produce cooler and coolers of ice (there will be a great deal of ice left over to keep the Sunday, Monday food cold, and the rest can be stored in a separate cooler on its own). Cover with wool blankets kept wet constantly (depending on temperature, wind, sun exposure) and then reflective tarps 
</p>

<p>
Keep one cooler in the cook tent for that day and possibly the next day’s food. It could also contain most of the dairy if desired. The cook should make a list of all cold food needed for that day and make one trip to the coolers.

<h3>If there is no snow</h3>

<p>Find an area near next to camp near a creek, lake, or water source and create a constantly shaded area with tarps. If storing in the creek, create a dam in the creek if possible to contain the coolers or stack rocks on them so they don’t float away. Keep watch after large rains or if it is a hot day when the volume of the creek may increase significantly.</p>

<p>Close to the creek and not in the water is best. Keep the two coolers for Tuesday to Saturday and a cooler holding ice separate, with an insulation jacket around and on top, under their own tarp and blankets, and keep the blankets constantly wet. Keep the produce cooler and any other coolers you may want to keep in the shaded cooler area separate under their own tarp/blanket system so as not to disturb the two “cold coolers”. Ice can be added as needed to any of the coolers as they are taken down to the cook tent.
