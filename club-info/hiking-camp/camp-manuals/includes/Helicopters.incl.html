				<h2><a id="sect-1-6-Heli"></a>Chartering Helicopters</h2>
				
				<p>
				Helicopter transportation is the most cost sensitive part of hiking camp and any problems can very quickly cause budget overruns. It is very important that all arrangements for the helicopter be confirmed and reconfirmed. It is necessary to be aware of potential complications and to have alternative plans available.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Go to google search for active Helicopter companies in your area , ie Golden. Revelstoke  etc.</p>
								
				<p>
				Once the camp location has been selected, contact the helicopter companies in the area to obtain quotes (normally those companies further away from the area will not be competitive) and provide information on the camp, a sample of which follows:
				</p>
				
				<blockquote>
				“The Kootenay Mountaineering Club (KMC) Hiking Camp Committee organizes wilderness hiking camps each year which consist of three (3) week long camps with twenty (20) people in each camp, for a total of sixty (60) campers over the three weeks. Campers usually drive to a helicopter staging or rendezvous area, normally on a logging road fairly close (5-10K) from the proposed camp location, which is usually at the 6500-7000ft elevation. On occasion we have been able to fly directly from the airport, but this is rare.”
				</blockquote>
				
				<p>
				Then describe the proposed location for this year, giving map number, coordinates, etc. All helicopter companies now use google earth. This is the most efficient method of communicating the camp site and pick up locations. Indicate the closest forest service road that would likely be used. Indicate when the recce is likely to take place, and that the Hiking Camp rep will be in touch after that to confirm the rendezvous location and go over logistics and other details.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Give dates. ( consult with the camp committee ), the schedule of flights for each trip and the approximate weight of each sling load going into camp. Give an indication of the contents of slings, particularly noting the two boxes (2' x 2' x 4') and that camper day packs contain mostly soft items. What goes into slings and the cabin will be determined by the pilot at the rendezvous site.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Request an estimate that includes type of helicopter to be used, ferry time from base, time of day for flights, number of camper and sling loads for each camp, duration of each trip, policy regarding forest fire fighting, cost per hour, total estimated cost and method of payment preferred. Include any other relevant information for that year and area. Request a firm quote and if possible obtain a performance guarantee for dates and times indicated in the quote.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				It is important to emphasize that the helicopter company will <em><strong>need to use slings</strong></em> given the nature of the gear we take into camp.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				It is desirable to shop around as different companies may have very different rates and costs. Large helicopters ( Bell 205, 212 or 214 ) are cost effective only if the ferry time from the base to the rendezvous location is very short (6-10 minutes). Check with Forestry in the area to ensure the road to be used is passable all the way to the rendezvous site (Logging Companies and the Helicopter pilots may also have this information. It is also necessary to check on any logging in the area to determine if logging trucks and/or other vehicles may be encountered during the three Saturdays of camps). 
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Do not pay in advance and indicate that payment is usually made within a month after receiving the invoice(s) from the company.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The budget for helicopter services should be in the neighbourhood of $20,000.00 or less and allow for 1 – 1.5 hrs flying time in reserve.  Anything greater may necessitate a camp fee increase.
