				<h2><a id="Tasks"></a>Camp Tasks</h2>

				<p>
				Only when the helicopter flights are completed, and camp tents, equipment, and coolers are set up, may campers attend to their own tent site. At no time should campers be setting up prior to that point. 
				</p>

				<p>
				On the first day of camp, the camp leader shall call a gathering before dinner to welcome campers, especially new people and make introductions. People with first aid and/or medical training will be identified.
				</p>

				<dl>
				<dt>Chores</dt>
					<dd>Chores are assigned by lottery on the first afternoon in camp and the duty roster is subsequently filled out.  Trading is allowed prior to filling out the roster and, if done post, the roster should reflect the trade, updating who will be doing what.</dd>

				<dt>Sign out</dt>
					<dd>Everyone to sign out and in each day! Generally, people should be discouraged from hiking alone.</dd>

				<dt>Report</dt>
					<dd>A volunteer to write up an account of camp for the fall newsletter (usually submitted by end of August). A volunteer to take a camp picture and email to all participants.</dd>

				<dt>Water Purification</dt>
					<dd>It is recommended that each camper use a personal filtration system for their drinking water. Water used for making juice and milk must be boiled the evening before and left to cool overnight.</dd>

				<dt>Dishwashing procedure</dt>
					<dd><ul>
						<li>Scrape food into the garbage and wipe plate with paper towel if food remains to prevent the pre-rinse basin from fouling.</li>
						<li>Use 4 basins in the following manner</li>
							<ul>
								<li>pre-rinse – warm water</li>
								<li>wash – hot, soap water</li>
								<li>rinse – warm water</li>
								<li>final rinse – warm water – add 1 capful bleach to 1 gal. water.</li>
							</ul>
					</ul></dd>

				<dt>Campfires</dt>
					<dd>Club policy requires we fly in fire logs (one box per camp); processed wood like heli sticks may be burned. The metal container (for fires) is placed on rocks or gravel to protect any vegetation. Cold ashes to be dumped (carefully) into the biffy hole or slop pit at the end of camp before turf is put back over the hole. Each camp empties burner so it is clean for the following camp.</dd>

				<dt>Food handling</dt>
						<dd><ul>
							<li>Done by the cook only, or under direction of the cook</li>
							<li>Cook arranges contents of the coolers and should be the only person getting food out of the coolers (so that they are not opened unnecessarily, causing food to thaw).</li>
							<li>Coolers to be stored in a cool location: a snow bank, shady grove of trees, in a stream – with drain plug inserted, weighted down and secured so they do not float away. Use space blankets to reflect sunlight ensuring there is air circulation under the blanket. Add snow or ice if possible and drain daily. Wool blankets soaked in water can also be used. For proper cooling wool blankets must not be covered with space blankets.</li>
							<li>At meal times, the cook may direct people on amount of food. For second servings it is usually first come first served; however, be considerate of your fellow campers.</li>
						</ul></dd>

				<dt>Wine and juice (as per registration forms)</dt>
					<dd>Ration for wine is 150 ml (5 oz) per person per dinner. Ration for juice is 250 ml (8 oz) per person per dinner. It is a good idea to have one person in charge of the wine and serving it. Juice is also available for campers in the morning.</dd>

				<dt>Hygiene</dt>
						<dd><ul>
							<li>Hands to be washed with a bleach solution or hand sanitizer after using the biffy</li>
							<li>Hands must be cleansed with hand sanitizer before handling food. This includes food preparation and serving meals. Bleach solution may also be used.</li>
							<li>Tea towels are not to be used for hand drying</li>
							<li>In the event of a participant having a gastro illness, the cook will serve their meals, and a volunteer will make their lunch and wash the dishes separately. The person with the illness is not to use the cook tent equipment (utensils, stove etc)</li>
						</ul></dd>

				<dt>Propane</dt>
					<dd>To be used for cooking only; not for heating water for bathing or hair washing. Also, as each camp has its own propane tanks, disconnect the propane tanks at the end of each camp and return to the Equipment Co-ordinator.</dd>

				<dt>Slop pit</dt>
					<dd>No food scraps to be placed in slop pit (use a colander to strain contents) and place solids in garbage</dd>

				<dt>Garbage</dt>
					<dd>Tie a garbage bag to the end of the cook tent table for wet garbage. Hang the end of the bag in an empty cardboard box for ease of packing when the bag is full. Compress the garbage as much as possible to minimize the volume. Tie the bag shut. Tape the box closed. Label it as garbage and store in supply tent until the flight out. Tin cans can be flattened and brought out for recycling at the end of camp</dd>
				</dl>

				<h3>Camp Tasks Specific To Camp One - Camp Set Up</h3>

				<p>
				The Camp 1 Leader has extra responsibilities.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Select a secure source for water. Make sure the water buckets can be filled without muddying the water or people falling in. If necessary, build a little dam and install the short length of 1" PVC pipe in the tent box as a spout to make it easier to fill the buckets.</li>
					<li>Select sites for cook and supply tents. Choose a dry, flat, grassy spot if possible. Avoid areas that have a lot of heather.</li>
					<li>After club tents are set up place plastic snow fence on the ground and staple down. This ground protector goes in very high traffic areas and protects the natural ground cover from damage.</li>
					<li>Select a site for the biffy. Find a place with well drained soil, that looks easy to dig in. Choose a site that is well away from any water course and some distance, and hidden if possible, from the cook tent. Choose sites so that any trails that develop don't go through sensitive vegetation (like heather) or easily disturbed soil (eg. wet spots). Dig a biffy hole (at least 24-30” deep, and about 18x18” wide). Set the turf aside so that it can be replaced at the end of camp. Set up the biffy tent and assemble the biffy seat. Make sure the tent is as far forward as possible so that there is lots of room at the front so that people can sit comfortably inside the tent without having the door draped over their knees.</li>
					<li>Select a site to store the coolers. Place all entrees for the last three days, some of the dairy and lunch meats in a separate cooler. A shady spot in trees with a snow patch nearby is best. If there are no trees, dig a pit in a snow patch that the coolers can be placed in. If there is no snow patch, find the best shady place to use. Use the tarp to provide shade and shelter over the coolers. Cover the coolers with the space blankets. Don't let the coolers be exposed to the sun. The wool blankets can be soaked in water and used to cover the coolers for evaporative cooling. As a last resort, the coolers could be kept in a creek. (Make sure the coolers won't float away if the water level rises during the day!)</li>
					<li>Set up the cook and supply tents, the cook tent table, and the propane stoves. Make sure the stoves are well away from the tent wall so that if the wind blows the stoves don’t get knocked over. The cook will be responsible for organizing the food and other supplies .</li>
					<li>Dig a slop pit for dirty wash water (18 - 24" deep and 18 X 18" wide in well drained soil and well away from running water). Set the turf aside so that it can be replaced at the end of camp.</li>
					<li>Choose a site for the campfire burning device. Find a site such that no vegetation is damaged. Placing it on several large rocks is best. Put about 1" of gravel or dirt in the bottom to give some insulation from the heat.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Camp Tasks Specific To Camp Two</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>Create a new path for the new biffy hole that is separate and apart from the first biffy hole. (It is important to do this in order to minimize the damage that is done to the vegetation from the path that is inevitably created to the biffy.)</li>
					<li>Ensure that two biffy holes are dug: one is dug the first day for camp 2, and one is dug at the end of camp for camp 3.</li>
					<li>Ensure that two slop pits are dug: one is dug the first day for camp 2, and one is dug at the end of camp for camp 3.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Camp Tasks Specific To Camp Three - Camp Take Down</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>Disconnect propane tanks and stow the stoves in the box. Propane hoses go in supply box – not kitchen box.</li>
					<li>Pack all the kitchen gear in the box. Stack smaller items inside larger buckets/bowls etc. to minimize volume. Packing instructions are on the inside lid of the cook tent box.</li>
					<li>Dismantle the cook tent table and re-pack it. Pack the table so that all the smaller pieces are securely held between the larger pieces. The smaller pieces are traced on the underside of the larger pieces to aid in packing. Don't use duct tape to wrap the table - it takes the paint off the table. The screws and nails used to hold it together can go in the tool box.</li>
					<li>Long bolts with wing nuts (in toolbox) are used to package table.</li>
					<li>Take down the cook and supply tents. Pack the tents and frames in their respective bags.</li>
					<li>Fold the stools and store them in the duffle bags (10 per bag).</li>
					<li>Disassemble the biffy seat and pack in its own case. The TP Tin, bleach water bottle (empty!), and the wire basket go in the supply box.	</li>
					<li>Take down biffy tent and fill biffy hole. Ashes from the “burning device” can go in the biffy hole or the slop pit before it is filled. Replace turf. Pack the tent in its own bag.</li>
					<li>Sprinkle any left over lime in the slop pit then fill it in and replace the turf.</li>
					<li>Pack all other small gear in the supply tent box.</li>
					<li>Pack the satellite phone and the battery. It is returned to KMC Hut Director immediately following camp . Ensure that someone is assigned to do this.</li>
					<li>Assign someone to donate all unused non-perishable food to the Salvation Army, Food Bank, etc. in Rossland, Trail, Castlegar or Nelson. All perishable, opened foods is divided among campers. Unused dry goods (see list) can be saved for next year.</li>
					<li>Ensure that all equipment is returned to the storage location (currently at Mike Brewster's).</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Campers In-Camp Duties (“How To”)</h3>

				<p>
				There are a number of chores that have to be done to make things go smoothly. Each person (excluding the cook) is responsible for 3 duties during the week.
				</p>

				<p>
				In-camp duties are determined by a lottery on the first day of camp. The leader places tickets for each of the duties into a hat and each camper draws 3 tickets. Trading of duties is allowed, but each camper is expected to do his/her own trading. After the draw and trading are completed the leader completes the duty roster that lists each duty for each day and posts it on the clipboard in the cook tent. Those on duty are expected to show up at the appointed time and complete their assigned duty.
				</p>
