					<li>Confirmation of a withdrawal needs to be provided by the person who is withdrawing unless there are exceptional circumstances. If two people are withdrawing then both people normally need to provide confirmation.</li>
					<li>When a person withdraws from camp, regardless of the circumstances, there is a $50 admin fee deducted from their refund.</li>
				
				<li>
				A $50 administrative fee will be retained by the KMC from any refund. If a substitute camper can be found, a full refund less the administrative fee will be given. If a substitute camper cannot be found, and the camper withdraws between May 1 and June 1 inclusive and no substitute is found, a 50% refund less the administrative fee will be charged. If the camper withdraws after June 1 and a substitute camper cannot be found, no refund will be given. 
				</li>
				
				<li>
				Cancellation vacancies must be filled from the waitlist first. Once the waitlist and the list of post March 15 registrants are exhausted, the withdrawing camper is responsible for finding a suitable replacement before a refund will be issued. 
				</li>
				
				<li>
				Camp leaders have the absolute discretion to exclude any camper from camp participation if they judge that the camper is likely to cause harm to themself or to other campers. In this instance the excluded camper is not eligible for a refund. You are urged to consider the purchase of travel insurance.
