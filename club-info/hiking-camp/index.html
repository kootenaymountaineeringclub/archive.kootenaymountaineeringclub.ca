		<h2>KMC Hiking Camp</h2>
		
<p>Each summer the Kootenay Mountaineering Club (KMC) organizes three one-week long hiking camps for interested members of the KMC. The camps are usually in remote locations, in areas further afield from the Kootenays. Participants, their gear, camp gear, and, food are flown into the selected site by helicopter. All camps are self-catered and unguided, where campers provide their own camping gear. There are twenty people per camp including a volunteer leader who organizes the pre-camp and in-camp set-up, as well as a volunteer cook. All meals are prepared and shopping is done by participants prior to going into camp.</p>

<p>Members in good standing as of January 31st of each year are eligible to apply to get into camp. There is preference given to members who reside within the geographical boundaries of the KMC, however, other members may apply. The deadline for the hiking camp applications is March 15th, which allows applicants to enter a lottery. Applicants are selected by lottery draw and assigned to camps according to the available spaces and their indicated preferences. There is a wait list for applicants who are unsuccessful in the lottery.</p>

<p>The cost of food, miscellaneous equipment, and, helicopter services is shared by the participants.</p>

<p>Detailed information and the application forms are available within the <a href="/club-info/documents/member-files/hiking-camp/">Member Only Documents.</a></p>

		<blockquote>
		
		<cite>Ron Perrier, in this excerpt from his <em><a href="camp-history.html">"KMC Hiking Camp History"</a></em> says ...</cite>
		
		<p>The amazing places we visit for three weeks that rarely have seen another boot print. A chance to see mountains throughout the Monashees, Selkirks, Purcells, and Rockies. Helicopter rides. Something for everyone – meadows, lakes, ridges, flowers, glaciers, moraines, wildlife, mountains of all difficulty. One of the best wildflower displays on the planet everywhere we go. The phenomenal, fine-tuned organization – 20 individuals, with minimal direction, prepare and buy everything we need to survive in relative luxury for a week, and then it is repeated by two more groups with equal efficiency. Volunteerism drives the basics of camp – everyone participates in a relatively equal way, costs are kept low, a sense of community develops.</p>
		
		<p>Our strong environmental ethic is intended to leave our camp site with only the remnants of our boot prints – plastic mats around the cook tent, replacing the sod over our biffy holes, straining our grey water, burning our own wood in a metal burner, even composting all vegetable waste in some camps. Spectacular, bountiful, home made food that, despite heavy exercise every day, usually results in weight gain. Wine. An incredible variety of fellow campers from all walks of life and life experiences.</p>
