		<p>Grassy Mountain is a horseshoe shaped peak, with a sub-summit (known locally as south Grassy) forming the southern arm of the horseshoe. At 1900 metres, Grassy Hut lies in the middle of the horseshoe just below the pass between Grassy and south Grassy Mountains. The cabin was built by the KMC in 1985, has four bunks (no foam mattresses), a bench table and seating, and a wood stove. Basic cooking utensils (pots, pans, cups, bowls, plates, cutlery, etc.) are stored in a plastic bin. There is also a two burner propane stove and lantern (take spare mantels). You will need to bring your own propane for the stove and lantern. There is NO water at the Grassy Cabin in either summer or winter.
		A two hectare area around the cabin is designated for non-motorized use only.</p>
		
		<p>Access in summer and winter is via logging roads out of Bombi Summit. Follow the following driving directions for summer access. Set your odometre to 0 on Highway 3 at Bombi Summit.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>0 km = Munson Road and Highway 3</li>
			<li>2.6 km = power line spur to (R)</li>
			<li>3.7 km = Lower Munson to (L), stay (R)</li>
			<li>3.9 km = West Munson to (L), stay (R)</li>
			<li>5.4 km = East Munson to (R), stay (L)</li>
			<li>6.3 km = spur to R, stay on mainline</li>
			<li>6.4 km = spur to (R) is Grassy access. Drive a short distance up this road (about 100 metres) and then park. If you have a two wheel drive vehicle, you will have to park off the main road and walk from there. On foot, follow the old road that leads up to the ridge south of Grassy Mountain. Hike downhill (sketchy trail) to find the cabin. Allow one to three hours hiking time. </li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>In winter, follow the same directions but ski directly from the highway. Allow four to six hours.</p>

	<p class="centered"><em>Note - As of 2016 we've added new propane camp stoves and lanterns to each of the cabins.  Folks must supply their own propane canisters for fueling them. The propane bottles are the 1 lb. Coleman bottles.</em></p>
