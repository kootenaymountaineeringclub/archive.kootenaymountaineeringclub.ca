	<p>Lying in a copse of large trees near 2000 metres in a basin on the southwest side of Copper Mountain, the cabin was built by the KMC in 1985 and is surrounded by a two hectare area for non-motorized use only. The Copper Mountain cabin is equipped with three bunks (can sleep two each top to tail, no foam mattresses), a wood stove, seating bench and table.</p>
	
	<p>Basic cooking utensils (pots, pans, cups, bowls, plates, cutlery, etc.) are stored in small kitchen cabinet. There is also a two burner propane stove and lantern (take spare mantels). You will need to bring your own propane for the stove and lantern.</p>
	
	<p>In summer, the normal access is via an old logging road in 49 Creek. This road leaves the small community of Blewett west of Nelson and is signed “May and Jenny Road” off Blewett Road (exits to your left as you head west). A high clearance four wheel drive is necessary. Follow May and Jenny Road (becomes Copper Mountain Road) for about 12 km to a pass betweeen Red Mountain and Copper Mountain. Either park at the pass (limited) or continue a further 150 metres along the road to a slightly larger parking area. There are no signs. Follow the old road on foot to reach the ridge south of Copper Mountain. An ATV track leads down to the cabin. Allow one to three hours walking time. There is NO water at the Copper Mountain Cabin in either summer or winter.</p>
	
	<p>Winter access is more difficult as the summer route crosses extensive avalanche paths and is unsafe for most of the winter. It is possible to access the Copper Mountain Cabin from roads in the Snowwater Creek drainage. Route finding skill is necessary. Most winter visitors to the cabin are staying at the cabin as part of the Bonnington Range traverse and will have skied across from the Steed Cabin.</p>

	<p class="centered"><em>Note - As of 2016 we've added new propane camp stoves and lanterns to each of the cabins.  Folks must supply their own propane canisters for fueling them. The propane bottles are the 1 lb. Coleman bottles.</em></p>
