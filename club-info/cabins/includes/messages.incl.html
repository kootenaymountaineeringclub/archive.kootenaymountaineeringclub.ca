<h5>Things to be aware of:</h5>

<p>This winter, 2013-2014, there have been a large number of reported vehicle break-ins and thefts from the Bombi parking lot. The local RCMP are working on addressing this problem, but we strongly advise people to not leave their vehicle and to make other travel arrangements. We will add any further information as soon as it is available.</p>

<p>Accessing the Bonnington Cabins requires both good navigational and avalanche skills. The Avalanche Terrain Exposure Scale (ATES) for this area is Complex. Please be prepared and exercise caution. Check the <a href="http://www.avalanche.ca/cac/bulletins/latest/kootenay-boundary">Kootenay/Boundary Region Avalanche Conditions</a> just before your departure date.</p>

<p>Wood is for overnight use only.</p>

<p>Please. If you pack it in, pack it out. Garbage and food left behind will attract rodents into the cabin. Thank you.</p>
