    <h3>Welcome to the Bonnington Cabins Booking System.</strong></em></h3>

    <p>This reservation and fee payment system means you can be sure you have a bed when
        you arrive at the cabins, and we can continue to maintain and improve the cabins.</p>

    <p>Please use the cabins respectfully and enjoy your stay.</p>

    <p>Please choose your reservation date carefully - there are <strong>NO</strong> refunds once a cabin is booked.</p>

    <strong>Warning:</strong></p>
    
	<p>There is a high possibility of vehicle break-ins and thefts from the Bombi parking lot. We advise people to not leave their vehicle there and to make other travel arrangements.</p>
	
<p>Accessing the Bonnington Cabins requires both good navigational and avalanche skills. The Avalanche Terrain Exposure Scale (ATES) for this area is Complex. Please be prepared and exercise caution.</p>
