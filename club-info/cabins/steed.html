		<p>At 2320 metres, Siwash Mountain is the highest peak in the Bonnington Range, and the Steed Cabin, a snug wood cabin built by the KMC in 1995, lies due south of the summit of Siwash Mountain by a small tarn at 2100 metres. A loft in the cabin can sleep four (no foam mattresses), while the downstairs is equipped with table, bench seats and a wood stove. Basic cooking utensils (pots, pans, cups, bowls, plates, cutlery, etc.) are stored in a plastic bin. There is also a two burner propane stove and lantern (take spare mantels). You will need to bring your own propane for the stove and lantern. There is NO water at the Steed Cabin in either summer or winter.
		The area around the Steed Cabin is popular with snowmobilers, so expect to see snowmobilers when you are staying at the cabin.</p>
		
		<p>In summer, access is via roads out of Bombi Summit. A four wheel drive vehicle is not necessary. It is possible to drive to a the head of Glade Creek, from here, it is between one and three hours of bushwhacking (thick bush with many black and grizzly bears in the area) to reach the cabin. Follow the following driving directions for summer access. Set your odometre to 0 on Highway 3 at Bombi Summit.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>0 km = Munson Road and Highway 3</li>
			<li>2.6 km = power line spur to (R)</li>
			<li>3.7 km = Lower Munson to (L), stay (R)</li>
			<li>3.9 km = West Munson to (L), stay (R)</li>
			<li>5.4 km = East Munson to (R), stay (L)</li>
			<li>6.3 km = spur to R, stay on mainline</li>
			<li>6.4 km = spur to (R) is Grassy access</li>
			<li>10.8 km = small pass, road enters from behind and (L), stay straight down the hill</li>
			<li>11.0 km = road forks, go (R) to stay on Munson Road, (L) fork is North Munson</li>
			<li>15.1 km = pass below Twin Peaks</li>
			<li>18.9 km = fork in road, go (L)</li>
			<li>22.6 km, = park here and walk the rest of the way.</li>

		<p>In winter, it takes two days to reach the cabin via the Bonnington Traverse route.</p>
			
	<p class="centered"><em>Note - As of 2016 we've added new propane camp stoves and lanterns to each of the cabins.  Folks must supply their own propane canisters for fueling them. The propane bottles are the 1 lb. Coleman bottles.</em></p>
