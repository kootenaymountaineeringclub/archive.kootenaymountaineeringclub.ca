    <h3>Welcome to the Bonnington Cabins Booking System.</strong></em></h3>

	<div class="announcement">
		<p>As of September 1st 2017, hut booking fees are $15 per person/per night.</p>
	</div>
		
    <p>This reservation and fee payment system means you can be sure you have a bed when
        you arrive at the cabins, and we can continue to maintain and improve the cabins.</p>

    <p>Please use the cabins respectfully and enjoy your stay.</p>

    <p>Please choose your reservation date carefully - there are <strong>NO</strong> refunds once a cabin is booked.</p>

    <strong>Warning:</strong></p>
    
	<p>There is a high possibility of vehicle break-ins and thefts from the Bombi and Porto Rico parking lots. We advise people to not leave their vehicle there and to make other travel arrangements for drop-off and pick-up. Some local options are:</p>

<p>Accessing the Bonnington Cabins requires both good navigational and avalanche skills. The Avalanche Terrain Exposure Scale (ATES) for this area is Complex. Please be prepared and exercise caution.</p>

<p>Please check the <a href="http://www.avalanche.ca/cac/bulletins/latest/kootenay-boundary">avalanche conditions for Kootenay / Boundary region</a>.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Remember, please pack out what you pack in.</li>
		<li>PLEASE do not leave behind any Food or Garbage in the Cabins as it attracts Rodents.</li>
		<li>There are new Propane Camp Stoves and Propane Lanterns in all the cabins for this winter.  The trouble is <em>WE DO NOT SUPPLY ANY FUEL</em>. Users are required to bring their own propane fuel canisters. Propane/Butane can be problematic in cold temperatures. For those that prefer using White Gas, those stoves and lanterns are still there as well. The propane bottles are the 1 lb. Coleman bottles.</br> <img src="../images/propane-bottle.jpg"></li>
		<li><strong>Fire wood supply at the huts is not guaranteed. People using the cabins should be prepared in the event all the wood has been used up.</strong></li>
